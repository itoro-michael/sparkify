# Sparkify Project

Sparkify is a fictitious music streaming service similar to actual music streaming services such as  
Spotify and Pandoras. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model, from the event log 
data generated by Sparkify, to predict whether a user is likely to churn. The project uses the Spark 
framework to create features from the log data, as well as for model training. The final supervised 
learning model selected is the decision tree classifier which has achieved an accuracy of 0.72%  and
an F1 score of 0.74 on test set.

The Project and data is made possible in collaboaration with Insight Data Science which is a fellowship program 
for aspiring data scientists, data engineers, and data product managers.

## Files in the project besides the README:

1. sparkify.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook file used for data preprocessing and model training.
					
2. report.pdf: The pdf file containing the project report for a technical audience

3. requirements.txt: The file housing the list of libraries required to run project.

### Instructions:
1. To run sparkify.ipynb, create a virtual environment and run the following from the project's directory:
	- pip install -r requirements.txt
